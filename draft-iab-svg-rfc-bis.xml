  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      Over the last few years the RFC Editor has worked with the
      Internet community to develop specifications for changes in
      the format of RFCs.  An outline of the resulting
      specifications was published as <xref target="RFC6949"/> in May 2013.
      Since then a Design Team has been working with the RFC Editor
      to flesh out those specifications.
      One aspect of the changes is to allow line drawings in RFCs;
      <xref target="RFC6949"/> says
        <list style="empty"><t>
        "Graphics may include ASCII art and a more complex form to be
         defined, such as SVG line art [SVG].  Color and grayscale will
         not be accepted.  RFCs must correctly display in monochromatic
         black-and-white to allow for monochrome displays,
         black-and-white printing, and support for visual disabilities."
    </t></list>
    </t><t>
      SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has been developed by W3C, the
      World Wide Web Consortium; its current standard is SVG 1.1 Full
      <xref target="W3C.REC-SVG11-20110816"/>.
      This document defines SVG 1.2 RFC, an SVG profile (i.e. a subset
      of SVG) that is suitable for RFC line drawings.
    </t><t>
      Note that in RFCs, the text provides normative
      descriptions of protocols, systems, etc.  Diagrams may be
      used to help explain concepts more clearly, but
      they provide supporting detail, and should not be considered
      to be complete specifications in themselves.
      <!--  they are informative, not normative. -->
    </t><t>  
      The details (particularly any vocabularies) described in this
      document are expected to change based on experience gained in
      implementing the RFC production center's toolset. Revised
      documents will be published capturing those changes as the
      toolset is completed. Other implementors must not expect those
      changes to remain backwards-compatible with the details
      described in this document.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="SVG 1.2 RFC: An SVG profile for RFCs">
    <t>
      As a starting point for SVG 1.2 RFC, the Design Team decided to
      use SVG 1.2 Tiny <xref target="W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222"/>.
      SVG 1.2 Tiny is an SVG subset intended to be implemented on
      small, mobile devices such as cellphones and smartphones.
      That should allow RFCs to be rendered well on such devices,
      especially those that have small screens.  However, RFCs are
      self-contained documents that do not change once they are
      published.  The use of SVG drawings in RFCs is intended to allow
      authors to create drawings that are simple to produce, and
      easier to understand than our traditional 'ASCII Art' ones.
      In short, we are also trying to improve access to the content in
      RFCs, so SVG drawings need to be kept as simple as possible.
    </t><t>
      Appendix A (below) provides a complete RELAX NG Compact (rnc) schema
      for SVG 1.2 RFC.  It is derived from the SVG 1.2 schema, and is
      the formal definition of SVG 1.2 RFC.  The remainder of this section
      gives a simplified - i.e. easier to read and dunderstand -
      overview of SVG 1.2 RFC.
    </t><t>
      SVG can provide a complete User Interface, but within RFCs, all
      we need are simple diagrams that do not change once the RFC is
      published.  Therefore, SVG RFC does not allow anything from the
      following sections in SVG Tiny 1.2
      <xref target="W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222"/>:
<?rfc subcompact="yes" ?>
      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText="12  Multimedia"></t>
        <t hangText="13  Interactivity"></t>
        <t hangText="15  Scripting"></t>
        <t hangText="16  Animation"></t>
        <t hangText="18  Metadata"></t>
        <t hangText="19  Extensibility"></t>
      </list>
      Note that SVG Tiny 1.2 elements may have many properties or
      attributes that are needed to support aspects of the above sections.
      Those are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.
    </t><t>
    Considering the other sections in SVG Tiny 1.2
      <xref target="W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222"/>:
      <list style='hanging' hangIndent='5'>
        <t hangText=" 9 Basic Shapes"></t>
        <t hangText="10 Text"><vspace />
          Everything in these sections is allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.
        </t>
<?rfc subcompact="no" ?>
        <t hangText="11 Painting: Filling, Stroking, Colors and Paint Servers">
          <vspace />
          Anything relating to 'color' is not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC,
          everything else is allowed.  This is a requirement documented
          in <xref target="RFC6949"/>.
        </t>
        <t hangText="14 Linking"><vspace />
          SVG Tiny 1.2 allows internationalized IRIs in references.
          In SVG 1.2 RFC such links must be ASCII only. That should
          not cause problems, since one can just use the URI form of
          any IRI.  Authors should try to use links only to URIs
          that are long-term stable.<vspace />
        </t>
        <t hangText="17 Fonts"><vspace />
         SVG 1.2 RFC only allows 'serif', 'sans-serif' and 'monospace'
         generic font families from the WebFonts facility, described
         in CSS 2.1, <xref target= "W3C.REC-CSS2-20110607"/>,
          section 15,
         Fonts. In particular, the SVG 'font' element is not allowed.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

  <section title="Elements, properties and attributes allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC">
    <t> Elements, properties and attributes selected for SVG 1.2 RFC
      from <xref target="W3C.REC-SVGTiny12-20081222"/>.
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 In the list below, elements and properties are listed on the
 left,and their allowed values are given in parentheses on the
 right.
 
 <color> is the list of allowed colors, a black-and-white
         subset of the SVG color names.
 
 <style> is a set of CSS attributes that are commonly used (by SVG
         drawing applications).  They are not part of SVG Tiny 1.2,
         but are included here for compatibility.  Note that
         - There is no guarantee that any renderer will implement
           all the CSS attributes a drawing application may use.
         - Authors will need to consider the compatibility of their
           drawings with rendering devices.

  <section title="How to create SVG drawings">
    <t>Many drawing packages can be used to create SVG drawings,
      for example Open Source packages Inkscape and Dia.
      Be aware that such packages may use SVG elements or attributes
      that are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC. 
      <list style="symbols"> 
      <t>For example, the 'marker' attribute is often used to place
        symbols such as arrowheads on lines, but 'marker' is not allowed
        in SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.  In such cases one has to draw
        the arrowhead in another, simpler way.</t>
      <t>SVG clip paths are used to define a shape; objects outside
        that shape become invisible.  The 'clipPath' element is not
        allowed in SVG 1.2 Tiny or SVG 1.2 RFC.</t>
      </list>
    </t><t>
      Diagrams produced with these packages may contain elements,
      their attributes or properties, or values of attributes or
      properties that are not allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC.
      We will need to provide a tool to strip out anything that is not
      allowed in SVG 1.2 RFC, or to replace disallowed values,
      e.g., 'sans-serif' for 'Sans' as values for 'font-family'.
      Experience with a simple test version of a tool for this has shown
      that such deletion and replacement can be effective for
      making SVG files from drawing packages conform to SVG 1.2 RFC,
      without visibly changing the diagrams they produce.
    </t><t>
      The tool described above can also be used by Authors simply
      to check that their diagrams conform to SVG 1.2 RFC.  To help
      with this, if visible changes do occur, the tool should 
      produce a list of non-allowed keywords and the context in which
      they were found.
    </t><t>
      To include a diagram into an RFC, the xml2rfc (v3) tool will
      need to provide a way to include SVG drawings in Internet
      Drafts, as described in <xref target='XML2RFCv3' /> sections
      2.5 and 2.67.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Accessibility Considerations">
    <t>One of the long-term goals for RFCs is to make them more
      accessible, e.g. to sight-impaired readers.  For diagrams,
      it would be useful for authors to provide alternative forms
      of the diagram, so that voice-reading software could be used
      to 'talk through' the diagram.  Simply reading the SVG code
      for a complex diagram seems unlikely to work.
    </t><t>
      SVG 1.2 RFC allows SVG's 'title' and 'desc' elements.
      'title' provides a brief text caption for an SVG object
      (much like a figure caption), and 'desc' provides a longer
      text description of what the object actually represents.
      As well, the SVG 'role' attribute can be used to indicate
      to a browser how an SVG object is to be interpreted.
      Good suggestions on how to use these elements are given in
      <xref target='SVG-ACCESS-TIPS' />.
    </t><t>
      ARIA is a W3C Recommendation for using SVG to create 
      'Accessible Rich Internet Applications.'  A helpful introduction
      to ARIA is provided by <xref target='SVG-ARIA-PRIMER' />,
      while <xref target='SVG-USING-ARIA' /> gives examples of how
      to use ARIA to enhance SVG accessibility.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Examples of diagrams common in RFCs">
    <t>
      Another way to create SVG drawings is to write programs to draw
      them.  For example, using python and its svgwrite module is
      a pleasant environment (for those who like writing code);
      this section presents a few examples of diagrams created in this
      way. Note that they are merely examples of typical diagrams from
      RFCs.
    </t><t>The SVG diagrams for this section can be seen at
      <xref target='This-I-D-with-SVG-included' />
      along with an html version of this draft that includes the SVG
      diagrams.
